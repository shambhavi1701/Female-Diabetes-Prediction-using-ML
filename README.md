# Female-Diabetes-Prediction-using-ML


# Overview
This GitHub repository contains a machine learning project for predicting diabetes in females using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and consists of various health-related features for female individuals. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify the likelihood of diabetes based on these features.
